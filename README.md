# Birthday Reminder Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to practice and get comfortable with state and props concepts in react. The project simple generates a list of people whose birthday falls today. At the moment, the project generates only the list of same individual on which ever date the project is started.

## Functionality

The project offers its users two options, either to remove everyone from the screen and when everyone is removed, a new option will be created which will allow users to re-generate the list again.

## Live Demo
